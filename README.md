# rustic-regular-expressions

The "VerbalExpression" [syntax](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/implementation/wiki/List-of-methods-to-implement) is pretty intuitively grasped.

If you think so too and you'd like to:
- read a hairy regular expression in verbal format
- have an existing regular expression read like code
- migrate an existing regular expression to the Verbal Expression supported by your language of choice.

Then you should try this project out.
